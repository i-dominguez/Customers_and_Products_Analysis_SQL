This repository contains a project from the learning platform Dataquest.

The goal of this project is to analyze data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract information for decision-making based on a number of questions that the company has made. The notebook containing the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/i-dominguez/Customers_and_Products_Analysis_SQL/blob/main/Customers_and_Products_Analysis.ipynb).
